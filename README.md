## Features

2. Open Chrome and go to the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
3. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top-right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The extension should now be active, and hovering over any `<span>` element on a webpage will trigger the rainbow effect.

### For Firefox:
